# Durable Workflows Reader-Value Pilot Packet

**Packet ID:** WF-RV-PILOT-001
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Prepared and unrun; no participant recruited or consented
**Scenario:** Meadowline Housing, entirely fictional

## What this packet tests

This packet tests whether the Workflows companion helps a reader move through
the complete value chain:

`RECOGNIZE A PROMISE OVER TIME -> NAME THE OWNER -> RECORD PROGRESS ->`
`HANDLE AMBIGUITY AND FAILURE -> PROVE THE OUTCOME -> HAND OFF A DECISION`

It does not convert the existing Northbridge or Aster Vale examples into
practitioner evidence. This is a separate, checksum-locked protocol for the
reader routes, gateway brief, failure tools, value ledger, and executive
decision language.

## Two stages

### Stage A — practitioner

Supply only:

1. [Consent and privacy notice](participant/01-consent-and-privacy.md)
2. [Scenario and task](participant/02-scenario-and-task.md)
3. [Practitioner workbook](participant/03-practitioner-workbook.md)
4. [Start Here](../../START-HERE.md)
5. [Workflow Responsibility-and-Progress Brief](../../workflow-responsibility-and-progress-brief.md)
6. [Compensation and Failure Matrix](../../compensation-and-failure-matrix.md)
7. [Time-and-Failure Test Plan](../../time-and-failure-test-plan.md)

Do not supply completed examples, the repository Failure Lab, facilitator
materials, the executive brief, or the value ledger during Stage A.

### Stage B — independent decision owner

Supply:

1. the frozen scenario;
2. the unchanged Stage A artifact and handoff;
3. [Decision-owner workbook](participant/04-decision-owner-workbook.md);
4. [Executive Decision Brief](../../EXECUTIVE-DECISION-BRIEF.md); and
5. [Value and Evidence Ledger](../../VALUE-AND-EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md).

Use a different person for Stage B during the first calibration round. Do not
let the Stage A participant explain or repair the artifact during the initial
read-back.

## Facilitator only

- [Facilitator guide](facilitator-only/01-facilitator-guide.md)
- [Observation and scoring rubric](facilitator-only/02-observation-and-scoring-rubric.md)
- [Results and deviation log](facilitator-only/03-results-and-deviation-log.md)

Never supply these files before either scored stage ends.

## Execution prerequisites

Before recruitment:

1. assign an accountable execution owner;
2. approve storage, access, retention, redaction, and deletion;
3. decide whether further ethics, legal, privacy, or organizational review is
   required;
4. freeze the exact files and referenced asset bytes;
5. record SHA-256 values in a run-specific evidence manifest;
6. keep scheduling identity separate from participant codes; and
7. assign a facilitator and evaluator with disclosed relationships.

The checked-in `SHA256SUMS` records the prepared source packet. A run-specific
copy must also hash every supplied referenced asset. Any byte change requires a
new manifest and, when meaning changes, a new packet version.

## Evidence boundary

A completed pair can reveal wording defects, unsafe interpretations, transfer
failures, and useful behavior for the exact participants and materials. It
cannot prove workflow correctness, reliable recovery, business value, broad
usability, or publication readiness.
